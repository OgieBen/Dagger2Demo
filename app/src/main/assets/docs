The annotationProcessor keyword, which is understood by the Android Gradle plugin,
does not add these classes to the class path, they are used only for annotation processing,
which prevents accidentally referencing them.


Dagger provides a way for the fields in your activities, fragments,
or services to be assigned references simply by annotating the fields with an @Inject
annotation and calling an inject() method. Calling inject() will cause Dagger 2 to locate
the singletons in the dependency graph to try to find a matching return type. If it finds one,
it assigns the references to the respective fields.



The injector class used in Dagger 2 is called a component.
